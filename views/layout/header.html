  Oversight.io, an ode the US government's oversight community.

  Built and maintained by Eric Mill. (@konklone, konklone.com)

  A Node app, with Express for a web server, and Elasticsearch
  for persistence. Open source, under a GPLv3 license:
  https://github.com/konklone/oversight

  This app would be entirely impossible without the public domain,
  volunteer-driven project to gather IG reports in bulk:
  https://github.com/unitedstates/inspectors-general

  Thanks to Lindsay Young, Travis Briggs, David Cook, Steve Pulec,
  Andrew Dai, and any contributors to that project not listed here.
